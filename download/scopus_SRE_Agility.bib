  abstract        = {The modern software industry is expected to provide fast software delivery and because of dynamic environment the customer requirements changes very rapidly, which has lead to inclination towards agile development approaches over other traditional approaches. It has the advantages like fast release and simplified documents which eventually lead to maximizing profit and productivity. However, it is a mammoth task to make a calculative decision about whether to use an agile approach for a given project or not because of the lack of any empirical decision making process. This paper provides a roadmap for making decision using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with Agility Indicator and if selected, it further suggests which Agile Development method is better suited for among popular methods like Feature-driven Development (FDD), Lean development, Scrum, Crystal Clear, Extreme Programming (XP) and Dynamic Software Development Method (DSDM). It also addresses the major concern about security requirements to enhance the security features by integrating security activities from security engineering processes without degrading the agility of the agile process. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

abstract={Dynamic and accessible web systems have gained utmost importance in modern life. Due to the competitive nature of such systems, they need to be superior as to performance, scalability, and security. Web systems typically require short time-to-markets, and it should be possible to easily implement new requirements into working web systems. These ideals have made agile methods especially suitable for developing such systems, as they promote productivity, facilitate continuous interaction with customers, and enhance the flexibility and quality of the software produced. When starting a web development project, selecting the methodology that fits the project situation can be an important factor in the ultimate success of the endeavor. In order to facilitate the selection process, we provide a criteria-based evaluation of fourteen agile web development methodologies. The evaluation results highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the methodologies as to their general processes, modeling languages, agile features, and web development facilities, and can therefore help web developers choose the methodology that best fits their project needs. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

Prominent agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), help quickly deliver a system that meets Functional Requirements (FRs), while adapting to the changes in the customer requirements and feedback. However, Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) by and large have been either mostly ignored or introduced and retrofit late in the software development cycle, oftentimes leading to project failures. With the recent, increasing shifts towards cloud and emphasis in big data in the software industry, NFRs, such as security and performance, have become more critical than ever before. This research proposes a novel approach to handling security and performance NFRs for projects involving big data and cloud, using Scrum. An industrial case study, conducted over a span of 9 months, shows that the approach helps deal with security and performance requirements individually as well as conflicts between them in an agile methodology. © 2017 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Due to the need to agilely cope with more complex and virtualized applications, integrating Software-Defined Networking (SDN) switches and OpenStack software platform into the data center has becomes an important enabling technology. However, the SDN controller and OpenStack have their own management interface, such as Horizon, which may not be able to meet the user's requirement on managing both platforms in one data center. For example, although the deployment of switches of a data center usually follows a layering hierarchy, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of management system of the SDN controller, such as Ryu, shows the topology of switches in a random and messy manner. Furthermore, tightly integration of SDN and OpenStack is required for agile and real-time management. Thus, in this paper, we design and implement a management system which tightly integrates SDN and OpenStack. In the proposed management system, the topology displays SDN switches, Open vSwitches (OVS), as well as virtual machines in hierarchy of multi-rooted trees. In order to display millions of virtual machines and thousands of switches, the GUI of the proposed management system provides a scalable view for users to zoom in or zoom out the topology. The proposed management system adopts modular design and provides web-based user interface and RESTful API for interoperability. The prototype of the proposed management system is shown to demonstrate the usability and scalability of the proposed system. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Security testing can broadly be described as (1) the testing of security requirements that concerns confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, authorization, nonrepudiation and (2) the testing of the software to validate how much it can withstand an attack. Agile testing involves immediately integrating changes into the main system, continuously testing all changes and updating test cases to be able to run a regression test at any time to verify that changes have not broken existing functionality. Software companies have a challenge to systematically apply security testing in their processes nowadays. There is a lack of guidelines in practice as well as empirical studies in real-world projects on agile security testing; industry in general needs a more systematic approach to security. The findings of this research are not surprising, but at the same time are alarming. The lack of knowledge on security by agile teams in general, the large dependency on incidental pen-testers, and the ignorance in static testing for security are indicators that security testing is highly under addressed and that more efforts should be addressed to security testing in agile teams. © The Author(s) 2017.},

Agile software organizations that deal with healthcare software system face a number of challenges to demonstrate that their process activities conform to the rules of HIPAA. Such organizations must establish a software process life cycle and develop procedures, tools, and methodologies that can manage the HIPAA requirements during the different stages of system development, and also must provide evidences of HIPAA conformity. This paper proposes an auditing model for HIPAA security and privacy rules in XP environments. The design of the proposed model is based on an evaluation theory which takes as its input the work of Lopez ATAM, and the standards of common criteria (CC) concepts. The proposed auditing model has been assessed based on four case studies. The auditing result shows that the proposed model is capable of capturing the auditing evidences in most of the selected case studies. © Copyright 2017, IGI Global.},

First, there is the need to bridge MBE to legacy system elements that were developed without MBE along with the need to handle hybrid Open System Architecture/Integrated Modular Avionics (OSA/IMA) based architectures. Second, there is the need for MBE to be reusable and interoperable across product development cycles as technology insertions occur. Third, there is the need for integration of MBE into synthesizable descriptions that can also be effectively validated for mixed general purpose, safety, and secure computing and networking environments. Fourth is the need for effective application of MBE in hybrid waterfall and agile development environments where target infrastructure is scalable in capability and cost. Fifth is the need for MBE to support partitioned roles across companies, government, and universities where one entity does requirements, one does architecture, one develops components, one provides formal test, and another provides system sustainment. There are a number of industry and university efforts underway to address these focus items and challenges spread across these adjacent MBE complex system domains. This paper is focused on the current state of each of these areas relative to use in A-IMA systems based on industry initiatives and academic research. It uses the driverless car for comparison as an emerging "Advanced Integrated Modular Architecture" and identifies its parallel approaches to address these focused items and challenges. This work is being built on the authors' work exploring dual use technologies being developed for the driverless car domain that will lead to a market of 10 Million autonomous cars operating in 2020. Previous papers have addressed identification of potential advanced automotive dual use transformational hardware and software technologies including many core processing, advanced software autonomy and data fusion components, unified mixed criticality networking, and integrated cyber security for A-IMA. A testbed has also been recently proposed as a mechanism to evaluate these dual use technologies in an A-IMA context. This paper extends the dual use view to include understanding of the best-of-breed avionics MBE environment and how it can be complementary to leveraging a testbed environment in addressing affordable, scalable, and open solutions. © 2017 by the American Helicopter Society International, Inc.},

This is much more true in defence applications with its unique requirements and challenges. Broadly the data link requirements in defence applications are seen under two categories. One, robust fool-proof zero downtime data links for telemetry, command and control. Second, broad band data links for data streaming and high bandwidth information exchanges. The data link platforms offered for these applications must therefore address the need to quickly prototype waveforms, be easy for field and use-case tests, support quick means for security layer add-ons and easily be amenable to technology adoption, ruggedization and deployment. This paper describes some of the challenges of design and prototyping for defence applications and presents how agile systems built with the right choice of design partition and architecture choices with hardware, software and waveforms can be cognizant of the challenges of the defence applications and illustrates few example cases with simulations and real field deployment trials. It is envisaged that the Agile Cognizant Transceiver (ACT) platform built, helps faster prototyping of defence systems and paves the way for faster product induction cycles in defence automation. © 2016 IEEE.},

Such a measurement indicates whether a system is working properly and meeting its requirements. Although security and dependability metrics are regarded as key metrics for measuring the quality of systems, they are not sufficient for measuring the quality of systems that are placed in a multi-domain environment including hardware, software, network, human factors, and physical environments. In order to embrace multidimensional aspects of the quality of a system, we introduce a trustworthiness metric framework that supports three key submetrics of trust, resilience, and agility, and propose an ontology-based framework with three corresponding sub-ontologies. We also discuss how the key metrics are related to the severity of threats and the quality of assessment tools.

abstract={In contemporary software development projects and computing tasks, security concerns have an increasing effect, and sometimes even guide both the design and the project's processes. In certain environments, the demand for the security becomes the main driver of the development. In these cases, the development of the product requires special security arrangements for development and hosting, and specific security-oriented processes for governance. Compliance with these requirements using agile development methods may not only be a chance to improve the project efficiency, but can in some cases, such as in the case discussed in this paper, be an organizational requirement. This paper describes a case of building a secure identity management system and its management processes, in compliance with the Finnish government's VAHTI security instructions. The building project was to be implemented in accordance to the governmental security instructions, while following the service provider's own management framework. Project itself was managed with Scrum. The project's steering group required the use of Scrum, and this project may be viewed as a showcase of Scrum's suitability to multi-teamed, multi-site, security standard-compliant work. We also discuss the difficulties of fulfilling strict security regulations regarding both the development process and the end product in this project, and the difficulties utilizing Scrum to manage a multi-site project organization. Evaluation of the effects of the security work to project cost and efficiency is also presented. Finally, suggestions to enhance the Scrum method for security-related projects are made. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Non-functional requirements define the overall qualities or attributes of a system. Although important, they are often neglected for many reasons, such as pressure of time and budget. In agile software development, there is a focus on the feature implementation and delivery of value to the customer and, as such, non-functional aspects of a system should also be of attention. Non-functional requirements testing is challenging due its cross-functional aspects and lack of clarity of their needs by business in the most part of projects. The goal of this paper is to empirically investigate how do agile team members handle non-functional testing in their projects, aiming to identify preliminary factors influencing the testing of non-functional requirements, specifically performance and security in agile development. We conducted interviews with twenty IT professionals in large multinational company. As result we could identify seven main factors influencing non-functional testing and four main practices adopted by them to overcome the challenges faced. We aim to replicate our investigation in a larger scale. Meanwhile, our work provides initial contributions to practitioners and inspires our future research. © 2016 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {With the maturity of service-oriented architecture (SOA) and Web technologies, web services have become critical components of Software as a Service (SaaS) applications in cloud ecosystem environments. Most SaaS applications leverage multi-tenant data stores as a back end to keep and process data with high agility. Although these technologies promise impressive benefits, they put SaaS applications at risk against novel as well as prevalent attack vectors. This security risk is further magnified by the loss of control and lack of security enforcement over sensitive data manipulated by SaaS applications. An effective solution is needed to fulfill several requirements originating in the dynamic and complex nature of such applications. Inspired by the rise of Security as a Service (SecaaS) model, this paper introduces "Information Flow Control as a Service (IFCaaS)". IFCaaS lays the foundation of cloud-delivered IFC-based security analysis and monitoring services. As an example of the adoption of the IFCaaS, this paper presents a novel framework that addresses the detection of information flow vulnerabilities in SaaS applications. Our initial experiments show that the framework is a viable solution to protect against data integrity and confidentiality violations leading to information leakage. © 2016 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Seamless integration of wireless networks for secure mobile applications has increased interest in the research area of mobile cyber-enabled systems. Multi-objective handover needs to compensate the different quality of services provided by the wireless technologies. Notably, the recent works select only the performance perspective on the network to suffice user requirements. In mobile cyber-enabled systems, the security policies are essential while providing the ubiquitous connectivity. In this paper, a novel Optimized Vertical Handover (OVH) framework is proposed to optimize and secure the handover process and reduce the handover execution time significantly. This framework integrates IEEE 802.21 Media Independent Handover (MIH) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) for seamless link establishment and agile network path reconfiguration. In the handover process, the network selection process is divided into two stages, such as pre-filtering and handover network selection. The pre-filtering eliminates the candidates with incompatible security capabilities using coarse and fine-grained methods. The network selection process utilizes the advantages of Manhattan and Chebyshev distance functions to feature the static and dynamic attributes during the handover. Among multiple factors, the OVH applies for compensation according to the network and mobile node states and improves the efficiency of the handover decision. Compared with the original VIKOR, the proposed OVH algorithm reduces the time complexity significantly through the periodic evaluation of dynamic attributes. Finally, the simulation results highlight that the OVH framework significantly reduces the handover delay and execution time. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The cost of software development is one of the major contributors to the development cost for safety systems in the petrochemical industry. It is hard to make developers work faster but it is possible to make them work more efficient. One way to achieve that is to introduce agile development methods. Agile methods are gaining increasing popularity in safety critical areas such as the petrochemical industry. Agile methods promise reduced costs and shorter time to market through incremental development, less production of unnecessary documents and more maintainable code. The IEC 61511:2003 standard is normally used by the petrochemical industry. The second edition of this standard will be issued in 2015. Both the current and the new draft edition IEC 61511:2014 of the IEC 61511 standard are evaluated against agile development approach in this paper. Both editions of the IEC 61511 standard have a strong link to IEC 61508. Manufacturers and suppliers of devices shall use IEC 61508, while system designers, integrators and users shall use IEC 61511. The IEC 61508 standard's relationship to agile development has been evaluated with success in a previous paper (Stalhane 2012). While the architectural design also in agile development is done up front, detailed design is done incrementally. Based on reported experiences in other domains, we expect the following benefits: • Easier to discover and correct faulty or incomplete system requirements • Simpler software, thus reducing the development and maintenance costs • Only documents that are needed, either for certification or development, are developed The ones that are developed are used and kept up-To-date • Improved opportunities for reuse and site development. The challenge is to introduce agile development without compromising safety. Development of safety systems needs to be compliant with IEC 61511. This standard impose rigor and additional costs, but proper adaptation of agile methods can add flexibility and efficiency. In order to evaluate this proposition we use a three step process: • Go through all relevant requirements in the standard and mark all requirements as (1) fully met using agile development, (2) possible to meet using agile development and (3) cannot be fulfilled "as is" using agile development. • All requirements in category (2) are studied further in order to assign them to category (1)-OK, category (2)-Adaptations to the agile method by including add-on's or category (3)-changes to the development process. • Suggest appropriate modifications to the agile development. This is the same process that we have used with success for IEC 61508 (Stalhane 2012) and IEC 60880 (Stalhane 2013). The work on IEC 61508 resulted in a method called SafeScrum. The SafeScrum model are reused and improved to fit the current and new edition of IEC 61511. There are no requirements in the current standards that prevents for an adjusted agile development process as SafeScrum. When the issues identified as category 2 in section 2 are settled, it should be straight forward to use SafeScrum and still be IEC 61511 conformant. It is now important to get one or more companies to try it out in cooperation with the certification bodies and/or authorities to get a reality check of the concepts discussed. This will allow us to identify possible problems and to make the adjustments necessary for industrial application. The main challenges are the IEC 61511 requirements on configuration management, traceability, detailed planning and documentation. However, in order to reap the full benefits of agile development, it is not enough to show conformance to IEC 61511. Suggested improvements of IEC 61511 are more requirements and information regarding modern software development methods. This is also in accordance with preliminary work performed by the current IEC 61508-3 maintenance committee. © 2016 IEEE.},

CCAF has four major types of emerging services and each one has been explained in details with regard to the individual function and how each one can be integrated. CCAF is an architectural framework that blends software resilience, service components and guidelines together and provides real case studies to produce greater impacts to the organizations adopting cloud computing and security. CCAF provides business alignments and provides agility, efficiency and integration for business competitive edge. In order to validate user requirements and system designs, a large scale survey has been conducted with detailed analysis provided for each major question.

Inter-VM communication is not only prevalent but also one of the leading costs for data-intensive systems and applications in most data centers and cloud computing environments. One way to improve inter-VM communication efficiency is to support coresident VM communication using shared-memory-based methods and resort to the traditional TCP/IP for communications between VMs that are located on different physical machines. In recent years, several independent kernel development efforts have been dedicated to improving communication efficiency between coresident VMs using shared-memory channels, and the development efforts differ from one another in terms of where and how the shared-memory channel is established. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the design choices and techniques for performance optimization of coresident inter-VM communication. We examine the key issues for improving inter-VM communication using shared-memory-based mechanisms, such as implementation choices in the software stack, seamless agility for dynamic addition or removal of coresident VMs, and multilevel transparency, as well as advanced requirements in reliability, security, and stability. An in-depth comparison of state-of-the-art research efforts, implementation techniques, evaluation methods, and performance is conducted. We conjecture that this comprehensive survey will not only provide the foundation for developing the next generation of inter-VM communication optimization mechanisms but also offers opportunities to both cloud infrastructure providers and cloud service providers and consumers for improving communication efficiency between coresident VMs in virtualized computing platforms. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={The requirement for fast and lean software delivery from the today's industry leads to adoption of agile development approaches over other conventional approaches. The Dynamic and competitive environment leads to rapid change of customer requirements which has also boosted the use of agile approach as it has merits like simplified documents and fast release which further leads to maximizing effectiveness and productivity. However, from security point of view it is very difficult to decide whether to use an agile approach for a given project or not, as there is no well defined empirical decision making process. This paper provides a roadmap for taking decision using Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process and Artificial Neural Network approach by calculating Global Agility Indicator and in case it is selected, it further provides Local Agility Indicator to decide among popular Agile Development methods like Extreme Programming, Scrum, Feature-driven Development, Crystal Clear, Dynamic Software Development Method and Lean development. The fuzzy AHP deals with the inability of AHP to deal with the subjectiveness in the pair wise comparison process. In order to compensate the decision maker's uncertainty, it takes into account a range of values instead of a single crisp value. Further Artificial Neural Network with back propagation approach is used to train the network and producing correct results even for inconsistent input. By taking such a systematic approach for development, it inherently addresses the major concern of security on projects using agile approach. © International Science Press.},

  abstract        = {The Architecture provides a blue print of developing system and plays a vital role to address many non-functional features such as performance, security, modifiability etc. It ensures that design will be able to support all requirements as well as able to support any changes that may be proposed. This requires planned design. Usually anticipating the change leads to complex design and requires more time and eventually maintenance of system turns to be more complicated. Agile approach, which advocates clear and simple design only for current requirement/change, emphasizes on evolutionary design. However on the other side evolutionary design may also lead to disaster since it grows as the system development and gradually in this case also it become really hard to alter code for new change. This paper highlights the balancing between planned and evolutionary architecture and optimize the entire design of system. It’s an extension of Risk-Cost Driven Architecture (RCDA) Model where we focus on calculation of both risk and cost. We aim to highlight different scenarios where extra focus is required on planned or on evolutionary or on mixed and that eventually demonstrate more robust and scalable design. We used Grounded Theory to analyze data collected as part of our research and concluded the result followed by applying to sample projects. © Research India Publications.},

Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a new way to Design, Build and Operate Networks. It replaces static, inflexible and complex networks with networks that are agile, scalable and innovative. The main idea is to decouple the control and data planes, allowing the network to be programmatically controlled. A key element of SDN architectures is the controller. This logically centralized entity acts as a network operating system, providing applications with a uniform and centralized programming interface to the underlying network. But it also introduces new security challenges. The challenge of building robust firewalls is the main challenge for protection of OpenFlow networks. The main problem with traditional firewall is that Network Administrator cannot modify/extend the capabilities of traditional vendor-specific firewall. Network Administrator can only configure the firewall according to the specifications given by the firewall vendor. To solve these problems we developed stateful firewall application that runs over SDN controller to show that most of the firewall functionalities can be built on software, without the aid of a dedicated hardware. © Springer India 2016.},

  abstract        = {To respond to business challenges with agility, modern businesses have to evolve quickly to stay competitive. Unfortunately, in many situations, proliferation of heterogeneous Information Technology shifts act as a barrier to innovations instead of as a driving force. Crucially, this is due to the confusions that they sometimes cause whilst Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are trying to elect the right technology solution appropriate for a given business challenge i.e. amidst various comparable options, claims, features and benefits from different technology vendors available in the market. To help small SMEs quickly make timely decision on what technology solutions are appropriate for a given business challenge i.e. given the vast array of solutions available in today's market, this paper proposes a guideline for an implementable solution for any SME with similar requirements to our chosen fictitious customer called EPM. The paper will cover main areas such as introducing a generic SME business case, analysing hardware solutions and methods typically employed in cloud networks to reduce costs. Then the paper will introduce the solutions as a repeatable framework to be critically analysed to find a suitable solution for the customer, this will then be looked into with any other cloud principals that could create a better fitting solution for the customer.

Whereas attacks have become more sophisticated that even simpler systems can be potential targets, so it is essential to treat software security within the agile method itself, in order to make it part of the process.

abstract={Separation of concerns is an important principle that helps to improve reusability and simplify evolution. The crosscutting concerns like security, and many others, often exist before implementation, in both the analysis and design phases, it is therefore worthwhile to develop aspects oriented software development approaches to handle properly the concerns and ensure their separation. Moreover agile methods attempt to reduce risk and maximize productivity by carrying out software development with short iterations while limiting the importance of secondary or temporary artifacts, however these approaches have problems dealing with the crosscutting nature of some stakeholders’ requirements. The work presented in this paper aims at enriching the agile development using aspect oriented approaches. By taking into account the crosscutting nature of some stakeholders’ requirements, the combination of the two approaches improves the software changeability during the repeated agile iterations. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.},

Network Functions Virtualization and Software-Defined Networks paradigms try to overcome these limitations by allowing more flexibility, configurability and agility. Unfortunately, the problem of deciding which security services to use, where to place and how to configure them is a multidimensional problem that has no easy solution. This paper provides a model that can be used to determine the best allocation for the security applications needed to satisfy the user requirements while minimizing the cost for the network operator, subject to the different constraints expressed by the involved actors. This model can be exploited to pursue an initial dimensioning and set-up of the system infrastructure or to dynamically adapt it to support the user security policies. Initial validation shows that allocations generated with our model have considerable advantages in terms of costs and performance compared to traditional approaches. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

  abstract        = {CyberInfrastructures (CIs) are complex socio-technical-economical systems that are difficult to describe, design, analyze, and evaluate. As one example, E-Health CIs are patient-centric community-serving systems that have particular regulations for information security, governance, resource management, scalability, and maintainability. We have built multiple successful E-Health interdisciplinary projects at the University of California, San Diego, including CYberinfrastructure for COmparative effectiveness REsearch (CYCORE) for cancer clinical trials, Personal Activity Location Measurement System (PALMS) for studying human activity patterns, CitiSense for sensing city pollution, and Integrating Data for Analysis, Anonymization, and SHaring (iDASH), which is a National Center for Biomedical Computing. These CIs have served their user communities well with respect to their projects' goals and durations. Due to their shared requirements, these systems were all designed around the service bus-based Rich Services software architecture. However, there are also significant differences in how these CIs were designed and implemented, which might be informative to the community of CI developers.In this chapter, we detail our experience with developing E-Health CIs from the software quality perspective. We start from generic CI requirements along with domain and application-specific requirements, and we analyze the tradeoffs of development and deployment choices and propose a blueprint for next generation CIs. The main question that we answer is: How can we improve the quality of the next CIs by capitalizing on lessons learned, the best architectural and implementation choices, and reusing elements from previously existing systemsWe present three contributions. First, we identify a set of activities and attributes that enable us to assess the quality of a CI with regard to important maintenance activities that are common to all CIs. These activities and attributes and the way we perform the evaluation are generic and can be applied to other projects and domains. Second, we analyze multiple projects and identify a set of common requirements for CIs and applications in the E-Health domain. We separate these requirements into common requirements that apply to all CIs, E-Health specific requirements that apply to CIs and most applications in the Health domain, and application-specific requirements. This separation makes many requirements reusable, and we expect that they will inform the development of future E-Health CIs and applications. Finally, we identify a set of architectural and implementation recommendations that will help developers create higher quality CIs for the E-Health domain. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract      = {Utility communications are increasingly required to support machine-to-machine (M2M) communications for hundreds to millions of end devices ranging from meters and PMUs to tiny sensors, high-powered sensors (e.g., intelligent electric devices), and electric vehicles. The Software Defined Network (SDN) concept provides inherent features to support in a self-configurable and scalable manner the deployment and management of existing and envisioned utility communication networks that will connect between end devices and application servers, or among end devices. The programmability of SDN technology allows the agile, elastic, and scalable deployment of present and future utility applications with varying requirements on security and time criticality. In this work, we first show that a well-known standard solution (i.e., IEEE 802.1Q +AFs-1+AF0-), which is popularly employed for virtual networking in industry, is limited to support large-scale utility M2M applications. Next, with some utility application use cases, we demonstrate that using the SDN technology (i.e., OpenFlow +AFs-2+AF0-), we enable elastically adaptable virtual utility network slices per-application to securely, dynamically, and cost-efficiently meet the utility communication needs. Specifically, we design a SDN-based architectural solution for virtual utility networks that will support self-configurable, secure, and scalable deployment of utility applications that leverage many end devices. Using two SDN-enabled Ethernet switches +AFs-3+AF0- available in today's market, the feasibility of our idea is discussed. © 2014 IEEE.},

However, like other agile methods such as Extreme Programming (XP), Feature Driven Development (FDD), and the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM), Scrum has been criticized because of lack of support to develop secure software. Thus, in 2011, we published research proposing the idea of a security backlog (SB). This paper represents the continuation of our previous research, with a focus on the evaluation in industry-based case study. Our findings highlight an improved agility in Scrum after the integration of SB. Furthermore, secure software can be developed quickly, even in situations involving requirement changes of software. Based on our experimental findings, we noticed that, when integrating SB, it is quite feasible to develop secure software using an agile Scrum model. © 2014 KSII.},

  abstract        = {Software as a Service (SaaS), a type of cloud computing is based on information technology (IT) capabilities in a utility model that enhances the reliability and scalability at relatively low costs as compared to on-premise IT systems. Other benefits SaaS provides to customers include: no upfront investment cost required, elasticity of computing resources, vendor support and upgrades, agile response to markets, usage metered as utility, resource pooling the ability to add computing resources as needed. Consequently, organisations may decide to adopt SaaS model based on these potential benefits. However, these benefits may have some implications on the roles of IT workers and functions of IT department. These implications include: changing IT workers' skill sets requirements, widespread of layoffs of hardware IT workers, and IT department loses control of IT-Servers, and focuses more on data security, vendor management, as IT system support moves to cloud service provider. Similarly, IT workers believe that turning IT resource and support to a cloud service provider poses significant risks to their own jobs [1]. There is a lack of research conducted on the implications of SaaS model on IT department and associated human resource management. Thus, this paper seeks to fill this gap by examining how SaaS adoption may change IT workers' roles and tasks, and functions of IT department. Drawing on adaptive structuration theory, a modified framework is constructed to support the change dynamics from SaaS adoption. Using examples of functions of IT department in tertiary institutions, we explored sources of structures from advanced IT and the ways in which organisational and human interactions have an impact on how SaaS is appropriated and institutionalised into business processes, and brings about changes in an organisation. This paper contributes to the theory by examining the way emergent and new structures are formulated at the macro and group level of the organisational structure. Implications for researchers and practitioners are provided.},

It is also possible that the agile team is not even aware of these effects causing dysfunctional system in terms of security and performance. This issue could be addressed by offering traceability mechanism that helps to trace the effect of functional requirement changes on the non-functional requirements. Unfortunately, there are a few researchers that provide study regarding this issue. Thus, this study attempts to present a Traceability Process Model (TPM) to tackle the issue of tracing NFR especially in security and performance. The TPM is compatible in Agile development processes such as Scrum and FDD. © 2014 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Agile development, and especially Scrum, has gained increasing popularity. IEC 61508 and several related standards for development of safety critical software has a strong focus on documentation, including planning, which shall show that all required activities have been performed. Agile development on the other hand, has as one of its explicit goals to reduce the amount of documentation and to mainly produce and maintain working software. The problem created by the need to develop a large amount of documents when developing safety critical systems is, however, not a problem just for agile development - it has been identified as a problem for all development of safety critical software. In some cases up to 50% of all project resources has been spent on activities related to the development, maintenance and administration of documents. Thus, a way to reduce the amount of documentation will benefit all developers of safety critical systems. By going systematically through all the documentation requirements in IEC 61508-1 (general documentation requirements) and IEC 61508-3 (software requirements) and by using the combined expertise of the five authors, we have been able to identify documents that are or can be generated by tools used in the requirement and development process, e.g. logs from requirement and testing tools and documents that can be made as part of the planning and discussions, e.g. snap shots of whiteboards. We have also identified documents that normally can be reused when issuing a new version of the software and identified documents that can be combined into one document.},

In addition to the BUFD, at the end of the development, a security evaluation process can take up to several months. In today's volatile markets customers want to influence the software design during the development process. Agile processes have proven to support these demands. Nevertheless, there is a clash with traditional security design and evaluation processes. In this paper, we propose an agile security evaluation method for the Common Criteria standard. This method is complemented by an implementation of a change detection analysis for model-based security requirements.

  abstract      = {Changing requirements are widely regarded as one of the most significant risks for software systems development. However, in today’s business landscape, these changing requirements also represent opportunities to exploit new and evolving business conditions. In consonance with other agile methods, we advocate requirements engineering techniques that embrace and accommodate requirements change. This agile approach to requirements must nonetheless be systematic andincorporate some degree of planning, especially with respect to accommodating quality attributes such as safety and security. This chapter examines the nature of requirements evolution, and the two main problems that it entails. The first is to correctly understand what is changing in the requirements, that is, the elicitation problem. The other is to act on that new information using models and otherrepresentations of the requirements, influencing the architecture and implementation of the software system. This chapter first motivates the importance of considering changing requirements in evolving software systems.It then surveys historical and existing approaches to requirements evolution with respect to the elicitation and taking action problems. Finally, the chapter describes a framework for supporting requirements evolution, defining the Requirements Evolution Problem as finding new specifications to satisfy changed requirements and domain assumptions. To motivate this, we discuss a real-life case study of the payment card industry. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

It meets security requirements of different scenarios by hardware and software co-design. Leveraging Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and OpenFlow techniques, Tualatin provides fine-grained security protection in dynamically changing network topologies, where both switches and security middleboxes are programmatically controlled by logically centralized controllers. With service-level APIs exposed, Tualatin could be easily integrated with other Cloud Management System (CMS).

A central issue in the design of an embedded system is the definition of the hardware/software partitioning of the architecture of the system, which should take place as early as possible. SysML-Sec aims to extend the relevance of this analysis through the integration of security requirements and threats. In particular, we propose an agile methodology whose aim is to assess early on the impact of the security requirements and of the security mechanisms designed to satisfy them over the safety of the system. Security concerns are captured in a component-centric manner through existing SysML diagrams with only minimal extensions. After the requirements captured are derived into security and cryptographic mechanisms, security properties can be formally verified over this design. To perform the latter, model transformation techniques are implemented in the SysML-Sec toolchain in order to derive a ProVerif specification from the SysML models.

The focus now is to exploit the cloud for innovation, utilizing the agility to expand resources to quickly build out new designs, products, simulations and analysis. As the cloud lowers the unit cost of IT and improves agility, the time to market for applications will improve significantly. Companies will use this agility and speed as competitive advantage. An example of the agility is the adoption by enterprises of the software-defined datacenter (SDDC)[3] model, which allows for the rapid build of environments with composable infrastructures. With adoption of the SDDC model, intelligent and automated management of the SDDC is an immediate priority, required to support the changing workloads and dynamic patterns of the enterprise. Often, security and compliance become an 'after thought', bolted on later when problems arise. In this paper, we will discuss our experience in developing and deploying a centralized management system for public, as well as an Openstack [4] based cloud platform in SoftLayer, with an innovative, analytics-driven 'security compliance as a service' that constantly adjusts to varying compliance requirements based on workload, security and compliance requirements. In this paper we will also focus on techniques we have developed for capturing and replaying the previous state of a failing client virtual machine (VM) image, roll back, and then re-execute to analyze failures related to security or compliance. This technique contributes to agility, since failing VM's with security issues can quickly be analyzed and brought back online, this is often not the case with security problems, where analysis and forensics can take several days/weeks. © 2014 IEEE.},

To achieve the purpose, we conducted interviews in software development organizations in Norway. Overall, we conducted twenty-one software practitioners' interviews from twenty-one different software development organizations. Findings suggested that agile methodologies are not preferred choice when developing large-scale projects, safety critical software projects and for projects in which requirements are known at upfront. Findings revealed that waterfall methodologies are more suitable for those kinds of projects. Waterfall approaches have many benefits therefore it is not recommended to discard it completely for sake of agile methods. On the basis of the findings and discussion, we recommend using combination of agile and waterfall approaches together. In this way, benefits of certain features from both methodologies can be used according to type of the project. © 2014 IEEE.},

In practice testing for security often is performed manually with the consequences of higher costs, and no integration of security testing with today's agile software development processes. In order to bring security testing into practice, many different approaches have been suggested including fuzz testing and model-based testing approaches. Most of these approaches rely on models of the system or the application domain. In this paper we suggest to formalize attack patterns from which test cases can be generated and even executed automatically. Hence, testing for known attacks can be easily integrated into software development processes where automated testing, e.g., for daily builds, is a requirement. The approach makes use of UML state charts. Besides discussing the approach, we illustrate the approach using a case study. © 2014 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Profitability is prime goal of every software organization. In the recent years, software development paradigm has vastly changed due to rapidly changing business requirements. Now customers demand for their desired products to be delivered in a minimal timeframe. To cater for these demands, different rapid development techniques termed as agile development and reusability phenomena are introduced in the software industry. With the help of reusable components, developing and deploying software products can be much easier and economical. Such approaches can help save cost and working hours so that the developing company can utilize its scare resources on other projects. But achieving accurate and precise reusability is not a piece of cake because along with economical and time saving benefits it comes with some shortcomings, such as it can increase the system complexity, can harm the architecture, degrade quality of the system etc. A proper storage facility of reusable components is required where an organization can save its important data and retrieve it when required. A wide range of standard repositories are used in various organizations for this purpose where important data is stored and retrieved. But in reality, every repository contains huge volumes of data and mostly no proper business standards of storing mechanism are applied. Though there are some repository maintaining software available in the market, but they only provide mechanism for storing artifacts. Maintaining the huge data volumes necessitates providing ample search assistance and putting in place precise reusable components suggestion procedure; therefore, researchers have to sift through loads of volumes of data within the repository for locating the intended component. In this paper, we discuss a novel concept of Central Value Based Software Repository (CBVSR). The proposed approach can assist users in finding the more appropriate artifact as it provides the best possible match against the user query. Proper standards have been followed in storing, deleting, amending and discarding data from the CBVSR. Data quality, security and integrity have been taken care of and indexing, tagging and classification are performed to provide technical assistance to developers. © 2014 SERSC.},

abstract={Verifying the security posture as a system evolves is indispensable for building deployable software systems. Traditional security testing lacks flexibility in (1) providing early feedback to the architect on the ability of the software to predict security threats so that changes are made before the system is built, (2) responding to changes in user and behavior requirements that could affect the security of software, and (3) offering real design fixes that do not merely hide the symptoms of the problem (i.e., patching).We motivate the need for an architecture-level testing for security grounded on incremental and continuous refinements to support agile principles. We use architecture as an artifact for initiating the testing process for security through subsequent and iterative refinements. We extend the use of implied scenario to reveal undesirable behavior caused by ambiguities in users' requirements and we analyze detection their security implications. This approach demonstrates how architecture-centric evaluation and analysis can assist in securing systems developed using an agile development cycle. We apply this approach to a case study to evaluate the security of identity management architectures. We reflect on the effectiveness of this approach in detecting vulnerable behaviors and the cost-effectiveness of refining the architecture before vulnerabilities are built into the system. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The consistent application of ATM Security requirements throughout the SESAR Joint Undertaking Work Programme is a challenge. There is a need to provide a tool for security experts, concept developers and technical experts to ensure compliance with the underlying framework for ATM Security. The software tool described in this paper addresses this issue. In particular, it supports functions that allow for the extraction, categorisation, association, and harmonisation of the rules imposed by the framework. The approach and challenges to the design of the envisaged tool capabilities are outlined. Initial lessons learnt are presented based on the findings at the current prototyping stage. It is reasoned that the feasibility stage is completed and that further development can adhere to the identified capabilities and design outline. User interaction specification and development will be facilitated with an iterative user-based agile software development process. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Context The use of Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) has emerged in the IT arena for the automation of business processes. In the majority of cases, the issue of security is overlooked by default in these systems, and hence the potential cost and consequences of the materialization of threats could produce catastrophic loss for organizations. Therefore, the early selection of security controls that mitigate risks is a real and important necessity. Nevertheless, there exists an enormous range of IT security controls and their configuration is a human, manual, time-consuming and error-prone task. Furthermore, configurations are carried out separately from the organization perspective and involve many security stakeholders. This separation makes difficult to ensure the effectiveness of the configuration with regard to organizational requirements. Objective In this paper, we strive to provide security stakeholders with automated tools for the optimal selection of IT security configurations in accordance with a range of business process scenarios and organizational multi-criteria. Method An approach based on feature model analysis and constraint programming techniques is presented, which enable the automated analysis and selection of optimal security configurations. Results A catalogue of feature models is determined by analyzing typical IT security controls for BPMSs for the enforcement of the standard goals of security: integrity, confidentiality, availability, authorization, and authentication. These feature models have been implemented through constraint programs, and Constraint Programming techniques based on optimized and non-optimized searches are used to automate the selection and generation of configurations. In order to compare the results of the determination of configuration a comparative analysis is given. Conclusion In this paper, we present innovative tools based on feature models, Constraint Programming and multi-objective techniques that enable the agile, adaptable and automatic selection and generation of security configurations in accordance with the needs of the organization. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract        = {Rare disease registries (RDRs) are an essential tool to improve knowledge and monitor interventions for rare diseases. If designed appropriately, patient and disease related information captured within them can become the cornerstone for effective diagnosis and new therapies. Surprisingly however, registries possess a diverse range of functionality, operate in different, often-times incompatible, software environments and serve various, and sometimes incongruous, purposes. Given the ambitious goals of the International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC) by 2020 and beyond, RDRs must be designed with the agility to evolve and efficiently interoperate in an ever changing rare disease landscape, as well as to cater for rapid changes in Information Communication Technologies. In this paper, we contend that RDR requirements will also evolve in response to a number of factors such as changing disease definitions and diagnostic criteria, the requirement to integrate patient/disease information from advances in either biotechnology and/or phenotypying approaches, as well as the need to adapt dynamically to security and privacy concerns. We dispel a number of myths in RDR development, outline key criteria for robust and sustainable RDR implementation and introduce the concept of a RDR Checklist to guide future RDR development. © 2013 Bellgard et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

  abstract      = {To proactively defend against denial of service attacks, we propose an agile multipath routing approach called random route mutation (RRM) which combines game theory and constraint satisfaction optimization to determine the optimal strategy for attack deterrence while satisfying security, performance and QoS requirements of the network. Our contribution in this paper is fourfold: (1) we model the interaction between RRM defender and DoS attacker as a game in order to determine the parameters by which the defender can maximize her benefit, (2) we model route selection as a constraint satisfaction optimization and formalize it using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) to identify efficient practical routes, (3) we provide algorithms for sound and smooth deployment of RRM on conventional as well as software-defined networks, and (4) we develop analytical and experimental models to investigate the effectiveness and limitation of RRM under different network and adversarial parameters. Our analysis and preliminary implementation show that RRM can protect up to 90% of flow packets from being attacked against persistent attackers, as compared with single-path routing schemes. Moreover, our implementation shows that RRM can be efficiently deployed on networks without causing any disruption for flows. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract        = {Continuous problems and deficits in developing complex and ever-changing (software) systems led to agile methods, e.g. Scrum. Nevertheless, the problem of considering a plethora of different functional as well as nonfunctional requirements (N/FRs) remains unsolved and gains in importance when engineering state-of-the-art software. The current tide of approaches aims at handling every single NFR by an individual process integrated into Scrum, yielding a process complexity which can not be handled properly. Scrum-based AFFINE was designed explicitly to provide an alternative solution to over-complex design- and development-processes and still considering all kinds of NFRs early enough in the process. In this paper, we discuss collected findings by using AFFINE in various projects dealing with the development of software for user-centered online communities towards some evidence of its suitability. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract        = {In regulated domains such as finance and health care, failure to comply with regulation can lead to financial, civil and criminal penalties. While systems vary from organization to organization, the same regulations apply for all systems. As a result, efficiencies could be gained if the commonalities between systems could be captured in public, shared, test suites for regulations. We propose the use of Behavior-Driven-Development (BDD) technology to create these test suites. With BDD, desired system behavior with respect to regulatory requirements can be captured as constrained natural language 'scenarios'. The scenarios can then be automated through system-specific test drivers. The goal of this research is to enable organizations to compare their systems to regulation in a repeatable and traceable way through the use of BDD. To evaluate our approach, we developed seven scenarios based on the HITECH Act Meaningful Use (MU) regulations for healthcare. We then created system-specific code for three open-source electronic health record systems. We found that it was possible to create scenarios and system-specific code supporting scenario execution on three systems, that iTrust can be shown to be noncompliant, and that emergency access procedures are not defined clearly enough by the regulation to determine compliance or non-compliance. © 2013 IEEE.},

We envisage advanced SF solutions would be able to help us with a better life style and our industries with a brighter productivity: (1) SF is a well-known and socially accepted hybrid device built on decades of maturity and of successful progress of mobile and wireless technologies, (2) SF stands upon the advancing pillar of our natural nomadic life style enhanced with superb connectivity, (3) ever growing personal and health needs are due to change in our social and healthcare systems and require SF’s safety and security features, and finally (4) the computing intelligence is there to be discovered and used for the most needed basic human requirements so that with it we expect to see a variety of integrated intelligence in the form of distributed and multi-agent style using software intensive, lightweight, and agile applications. We also enhance our message by exemplifying few but informative typical application cases for researchers and developers to help to harness this unique technological development opportunity. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Now a day most of the applications are developed as a Layered Security Architecture Pattern, typically we have user presentation layer, Business Logic Layer and Database access layer. Now Agile modeling is used in all applications design (but Agile Modeled Architectures are given little importance) because of shortened developed time, with customer collaborations with developers and importantly with Test Driven Development approaches.

abstract={Complex software is becoming an important component of modern safety-critical systems. To assure the correct function of such software, the development processes are heavily regulated by international standards, often making the process very rigid, unable to accommodate changes, causing late integration and increasing the cost of development. Agile methods have been introduced to address these issues in several software domains, but their use in safety-critical applications remains to be investigated. This paper provides an initial analysis of agile practices in the context of software development for the European railway sector, regulated by the EN 50128 standard. The study complements previous studies on the use of agile methods in other regulated domains. A systematic mapping between EN 50128 requirements and agile practices showed that all practices support some objectives of the standard. Important supporting features recognized were focus on simple design, test automation, coding standards, continuous integration and validation. However, several problematic areas were also identified, including vague requirement analysis and change management. Most agile practices must be adapted to suit regulated software development and this analysis outlines a subset of the required changes. © 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {The changing landscape of defense and security applications, as well as existing needs in other domains, has given rise to the need to design and develop information fusion systems that entail the combination of hard (physical sensor) data and observations from humans (soft data) in a distributed networked environment ([1], [2]). Such fusion processes stress both traditional fusion-based algorithmic design strategies as well as imputing requirements onto the design of appropriate decentralized architectures. In designing a framework for such an environment, the system architecture must be considered both at the level of information infrastructure and at the network/software level of implementation. From the information infrastructure perspective, primary concerns include which observations will be fed into the system, the intended goals (e.g. data mining, hypothesis generation/testing), how humans interact with the system (e.g. information gathering, analysis, process evaluation/refinement), and which levels of state estimation and fusion are appropriate at a given stage of the process [3]. Bisantz et al [4] discuss aspects of how humans interact with such new distributed networked information fusion systems and identify "touch points" where innovations can support improved system performance. An effective network/software architecture is tightly intertwined with the information infrastructure. The former must meet the functional requirements of the latter without adding unnecessary complexity, prohibiting scalability or extensibility, putting undue performance limitations on the system, or compromising system security. Additionally, the system must have the agility and flexibility to successfully and rapidly complete complex tasks that were not possible to anticipate at design-time. This paper presents an information infrastructure for hard and soft fusion that balances the features offered by the current state of the art in computing paradigms (e.g. SOA, ESB) and data representation (e.g. RDF, OWL, TML, EML) with the requirements of our overarching concept of employment for hard and soft fusion capability. The paper provides guidance on determining the optimal software and network architecture design for enabling human-centric and distributed operations in time-critical, vastly heterogeneous, and highly unpredictable conditions. The designs described have been implemented using both synthetic data from our SYNCOIN data set ([5], [6]) and actual sensor/observational data collected at a Penn State test site. © 2012 ISIF (Intl Society of Information Fusi).},

  abstract        = {The development of collaborative service ecosystem relies mostly on software services spanning multiple organisations in order to provide agile support for business applications. By moving part of their information system on Cloud infrastructure, companies take advantage of new Business models and scalable environments, increasing IT productivity while reducing IS management costs. Nevertheless, this underlying outsourcing strategy may be braked by a lack of security and trust on this new infrastructure model as traditional security engineering and deployment methods are not designed for such an agile and opened environment. To overcome this limit, we propose a multi-dimensional model integrating both the cloud level (XaaS) and the cloud characteristics (Private, public, hybrid) to generate convenient security policy in a dynamic way. Based on security patterns, our multi-dimensional solution has been implemented to capture security requirements related to both information system design and runtime environment.},

However, agile methodologies have not sufficiently identified, modeled, and linked Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)-such as security and performance-with FRs in early requirements phases. This research presents a lightweight engineering of NFRs for agile processes. The proposed Non-functional Requirements Modeling for Agile Processes (NORMAP) Methodology identifies, links, and models Agile Loose Cases (ALCs) with Agile Use Cases (AUCs) and Agile Choose Cases (ACCs). A lightweight adapted version of the NFR Framework was developed including 25 important NFRs. Further, a risk-driven agile requirements implementation sequence and a visual tree-like view were developed. The methodology was validated through developing a Java-based modeling simulation tool and two case studies. © 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {The rapid development of software nowadays requires the high speed software product delivery by development teams. In order to deliver the product faster, the development teams make a transformation to their conventional software development lifecycle to agile development method which can enable them towards speedy delivery of software coping with the requirements-change phenomenon. In this scenario, one of the most popular techniques in Agile development is the Scrum methodology which has been criticised in term of its security aspect cycle that ignores the security risk management activity. However, the current practices suggest that security should be considered during all stages of the software development life cycle. In order to address the aforementioned issue, this paper proposes the integration of security principles in development phases using scrum and suggests the element of security backlog that can be used as security features analysis and implementation in scrum phases. © 2011 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {This report presents some important factors related to safety-critical software in machinery. The following subjects are considered in the text, bearing in mind the subject: The role of safety-critical software in machinery, statistics of software faults, requirements, safety and security principles, risk and hazard modelling, agile development, safety process patterns, safety-related architectures, verification and validation, phases of development and formal methods. The general observation is that there are many methods for software design and it is difficult to choose the most relevant ones. The report shows some criteria for selecting methods and some aspects related to current topics. There are so many different safety-critical software applications in machinery that the research found the most interesting topics and then focused on them. The statistics show that most defects arise during the requirements specification and architectural design phases of the lifecycle. This is before any coding. The statistics also show that the defect density is higher in large programs, i.e. the number of defects increases exponentially as the program size grows. It may therefore be better to separate safety-critical and standard code in order to keep the first one small. The separation of modules and keeping the connections between modules under control and narrow is recommended in order to have advantages in testing, understanding of the program, limited error spreading, program development etc. There are many kinds of self-diagnostic and monitoring functions that may be complex and increase the number of defects, but they increase safety and are needed in safety-critical code. The standard IEC 61508-3, published in 2010, lays down many functional requirements for safetycritical programmable systems. However, there are also other standards related to functional safety and the safety of control systems. This paper also considers some aspects related to the safety of agile methods. The standards show the requirements related to the phases of the V-model, but agile methods are not considered. The functional safety of software is achieved through systematic (not intuitional) use of adequate methods in all phases of the programmable system lifecycle. Programmable systems contain hardware and software, both of which need to be considered in the validation process. Copyright © VTT 2011.},

However, most agile-developed software today needs to satisfy baseline security requirements, so that we need to focus on how to achieve this this level for typical agile projects. In this paper, we provide insights from the practitioner's perspective on security in agile development and report on exploratory, qualitative findings from interviews. Our findings extend the theoretical prior work and suggest to focus on adequate customer involvement, developer security awareness and expertise, and continuously improving the development process for security. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={The introduction of software technology in a life-dependent environment requires the development team to execute a process that ensures a high level of software reliability and correctness. Despite their popularity, agile methods are generally assumed to be inappropriate as a process family in these environments due to their lack of emphasis on documentation, traceability, and other formal techniques. Agile methods, notably Scrum, favor empirical process control, or small constant adjustments in a tight feedback loop. This paper challenges the assumption that agile methods are inappropriate for safety-critical software development. Agile methods are flexible enough to encourage the right amount of ceremony; therefore if safety-critical systems require greater emphasis on activities, such as formal specification and requirements management, then an agile process will include these as necessary activities. Furthermore, agile methods focus more on continuous process management and code-level quality than classic software engineering process models. We present our experiences on the image-guided surgical toolkit (IGSTK) project as a backdrop. IGSTK is an open source software project employing agile practices since 2004. We started with the assumption that a lighter process is better, focused on evolving code, and only adding process elements as the need arose. IGSTK has been adopted by teaching hospitals and research labs, and used for clinical trials. Agile methods have matured since the academic community suggested almost a decade ago that they were not suitable for safety-critical systems; we present our experiences as a case study for renewing the discussion. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

However, previous security applications can not provide adequate protection due to the untrusted execution environment. Furthermore, these security strategies cannot support a universal cross-platform system security requirements. This paper presents VASP, a hypervisor based monitor which allows a trusted execution environment to monitor various malicious behaviors in the operating system. This is achieved by taking advantage of ×86 hardware virtualization and self-transparency technology, and providing a unified security protection to unmodified operating systems such as Linux and Windows. Our design is targeted at establishing a security monitor which resides completely outside of the target OS environment with a negligible overhead. According to the security analysis and performance experiment result, our approach can effectively protect applications and the kernel at a modest overhead of only 0.9% average in Windows XP and 2.6% average in Linux. © 2011 ACM.},

The key point in our framework is that we are embedding a hybrid technique for requirement elicitation with Agile Software Development (ASD).

  abstract        = {Decision Trees, algorithms, software code, risk management, reports, plans, drawings, change control, presentations, and analysis- all useful tools and efforts but time consuming, resource intensive, and potentially costly for projects that have absolute schedule and budget constraints. What are necessary and prudent efforts when a customer calls with a major security problem that needs to be fixed with a proven, off-the-approval-list, multi-layered integrated system with high visibility and limited funding and expires at the end of the Fiscal Year? Whether driven by budget cycles, safety, or by management decree, many such projects begin with generic scopes and funding allocated based on a rapid management "guestimate." Then a Project Manager (PM) is assigned a project with a predefined and potentially limited scope, compressed schedule, and potentially insufficient funding. The PM is tasked to rapidly and cost effectively coordinate a requirements-based design, implementation, test, and turnover of a fully operational system to the customer, all while the customer is operating and maintaining an existing security system. Many project management manuals call this an impossible project that should not be attempted. However, security is serious business and the reality is that rapid deployment of proven systems via an "Extreme Project" is sometimes necessary. Extreme Projects can be wildly successful but require a dedicated team of security professionals lead by an experienced project manager using a highly-tailored and agile project management process with management support at all levels, all combined with significant interface with the customer. This paper does not advocate such projects or condone eliminating the valuable analysis and project management techniques. Indeed, having worked on a well-planned project provides the basis for experienced team members to complete Extreme Projects. This paper does, however, provide insight into what it takes for projects to be successfully implemented and accepted when completed under extreme conditions. ©2010 IEEE.},

The added value of an ULSSIS emerges from the interplay of a set of constituent systems, both existing and emerging systems. We see the systems-of-systems integration challenge as a major concern for ULSSIS. System integration has to address systematic and seamless composition of services, consider upfront crosscutting concerns such as policy and security, assure system dependability and quality of service, and show agility to deal with changes in the requirements and the environment in which the ULSSIS operates. In this paper, we present some of the challenges for service composition, propose an architectural style for addressing them, and discuss the experience gain in designing an ULSSIS, namely the infrastructure for ocean observatories. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

We further analyse how this collection of practices helps mitigate some, while exacerbating other risks in RE. We provide a framework for evaluating the impact and appropriateness of agile RE practices by relating them to RE risks. Two risks that are intractable by agile RE practices emerge from the analysis. First, problems with customer inability and a lack of concurrence among customers significantly impact agile development. Second, risks associated with the neglecting non-functional requirements such as security and scalability are a serious concern. Developers should carefully evaluate the risk factors in their project environment to understand whether the benefits of agile RE practices outweigh the costs imposed by the challenges. © 2007 The Authors.

  abstract        = {The Internet Protocol Security Architecture IPsec is hard to deploy in large, nested, or dynamic scenarios. The major reason for this is the need for manual configuration of the cryptographic tunnels, which grows quadratically with the total amount of IPsec gateways. This way of configuration is error-prone, cost-intensive and rather static. When private addresses are used in the protected subnetworks, the problem becomes even worse as the routing cannot rely on public infrastructures. In this article, we present a fully automated approach for the distributed configuration of IPsec domains. Utilizing peer-to-peer technology, our approach scales well with respect to the number of managed IPsec gateways, reacts robust to network failures, and supports the configuration of nested networks with private address spaces. We analyze the security requirements and further desirable properties of IPsec policy negotiation, and show that the distribution of security policy configuration does not impair security of transmitted user data in the resulting virtual private network (VPN). Results of a prototype implementation and simulation study reveal that the approach offers good characteristics for example with respect to quick reconfiguration of all gateways after a central power failure (robustness), or after insertion of new gateways (scalability and agility). © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},

Programming language: Embarcadero C++ Builder. Computer: Intel Core Duo-based PC. Operating system: Windows XP, Vista, 7. RAM: more than 1 GB. Classification: 4.3, 7.2, 6.2, 8, 14. Catalogue identifier of previous version: ADUY_v3_0. Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 180 (2009) 2394. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: No. Nature of problem: An application that implements numerical simulations should be constructed according to the CSFAR rules: clear and well-documented, simple, fast, accurate, and robust. A clearly written, externally and internally documented program is much easier to understand and modify. A simple program is much less prone to error and is more easily modified than one that is complicated. Simplicity and clarity also help make the program flexible. Making the program fast has economic benefits. It also allows flexibility because some of the features that make a program efficient can be traded off for greater accuracy. Making the program fast also has the benefit of allowing longer calculations with better resolution. The compromise between speed and accuracy has always posted one of the most troublesome challenges for the programmer. Almost all advances in numerical analysis have come about trying to reach these twin goals. Change in the basic algorithms will give greater improvements in accuracy and speed than using special numerical tricks or changing programming language. A robust program works correctly over a broad spectrum of input data. Solution method: The computational model of the program is based on the use of a dynamical diffraction theory in which the electrons are taken to be diffracted by a potential, which is periodic in the dimension perpendicular to the surface. In the case of a disordered surface we can use the proportional model of the scattering potential, in which the potential of a partially filled layer is taken to be the product of the coverage of this layer and the potential of a fully filled layer:Un (θ, z) = under(∑, n) under(∑, i) θn (ti / τ) Un (1, zi), where Un (1, zi) stands for the potential for the full nth layer, and Un (θ, z) the potential of the growing layer. Reasons for new version: Responding to the user feedback the RHEEDGr_09 program has been upgraded to a standard that allows carrying out computations of the RHEED intensities for a disordered surface. Also, functionality and documentation of the program have been improved. Summary of revisions:1.The logical structure of the Platform-Specific Model of the RHEEDGr_09 program has been modified according to the scheme showed in Fig. 1*. The class diagram in Fig. 1* is a static view of the main platform-specific elements of the RHEED1DProcess architecture. Fig. 2* provides a dynamic view by showing the creation and destruction simplistic sequence diagram for the process. Fig. 3* shows the RHEED1DProcess use case model.2.As can be seen in Figs. 2-3* the RHEED1DProcess has been designed as a slave process that runs as a separate thread inside each transaction generated by the master Growth09 program (see A. Daniluk, Model-Driven Development for scientific computing. Computations of RHEED intensities for a disordered surface. Part II).3.The RHEED1DProcess requires the user to provide the appropriate parameters for the crystal structure under investigation. These parameters are loaded from the parameters.ini file at run-time. Instructions on the preparation of the .ini files can be found in the new distribution.4.The RHEED1DProcess requires the user to provide the appropriate values of the layers of coverage profiles. The CoverageProfiles.dat file (generated by Growth09 master application) at run-time loads these values.5.The RHEED1DProcess enables carrying out one-dimensional dynamical calculations for the fcc lattice, with a two-atoms basis and fcc lattice, with one atom basis but yet the zeroth Fourier component of the scattering potential in the TRHEED1D::crystPotUg() function can be modified according to users' specific application requirements. * The figures mentioned can be downloaded, see "Supplementary material" below. Unusual features: The program is distributed in the form of main projects RHEED1DProcess.cbproj and Graph2D0x.cbproj with associated files, and should be compiled using Embarcadero RAD Studio 2010 along with Together visual-modelling platform. The program should be compiled with English/USA regional and language options. Additional comments: This version of the RHEED program is designed to run in conjunction with the GROWTH09 (ADVL_v3_0) program. It does not replace the previous, stand alone, RHEEDGR-09 (ADUY_v3_0) version. Running time: The typical running time is machine and user-parameters dependent.

Hafner and Breu set a different focus. Based on the paradigm of model-driven security, they show how to systematically design and realize security-critical applications for SOAs. In their presentation, they first detail how systems and security engineering go hand in hand and are integrated from the very start in the requirements elicitation and the design phase. In a second step, they apply the principles of model-driven security to SOAs. Model-driven security is an engineering paradigm that aims at the automatic generation of security-critical executable software for target architectures. Based on the general principles of model-driven software development, the automation of security engineering through proven and reliable mechanisms guarantees correctness and facilitates an agile and flexible approach to the implementation and high-level management of security-critical systems. Their book addresses IT professionals interested in the design and realization of modern security-critical applications. It presents a synthesis of various best practices, standards and technologies from model-driven software development, security engineering, and SOAs. As a reader, you will learn how to design and realize SOA security using the framework of an extensible domain architecture for model-driven security. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

  abstract      = {Ensuring software quality in the presence of multiple software development methodologies such as agile and waterfall models is a challenging task. Web applications are released to customers in "Beta" mode due to tremendous pressure on "time-to-market". In order to check end-to-end functional behavior of web applications, conventional testing tools have not matched short release cycles and have not kept up with agile software methodologies. In this paper we present a tool framework called WEb Applications Validation Environment (WEAVE) for checking functional behavior such as business logic and security of web applications. We have used WEAVE for finding defects in large Javacentric commercial-strength Web applications. As part of WEAVE, we have developed (1) a semi-automatic method for environment generation to constrain the behavior of the application for scalability, (2) an intuitive interface for engineers to construct requirements that are compiled into temporal logic to address the issue of usability, and (3) symbolic execution tailored to finding business logic and security defects. We describe how we have architected WEAVE as a web service for company's internal software teams to improve software quality without an upfront investment in licenses and computing infrastructure. © 2009 IEEE.},

  abstract      = {The Software as a Service (SaaS) delivery model has recently become an acceptable business model for software delivery. However, the attractiveness of SaaS to customers, with their low upfront costs and seamless delivery, changes the game in ways that challenge traditional software development methodologies. As customers begin to treat software as an on demand utility, expectations of high uptime, predictable quality, strong security and privacy, and lower total costs become at least as critical as time-honored feature functionality requirements. The efficiency and accuracy of delivery can make or break a business. As demands upon the service increase and change, the resilience and transparent scalability of the operational architecture becomes as important as that of the software running within it. This paper explores how these new challenges parallel modern demands within manufacturing, and how many key Lean manufacturing techniques might be applicable within this emerging field. © 2009 IEEE.},

The analysis of functional and non-functional requirements does not only encompass the descriptive aspects of functionality, it must also satisfy user needs such as usability, as understood in terms of efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction of use. At the same time, the analysis should cover other important conditioning factors such as system reliability and security. This article is based on the InterMod methodology whose objective is to facilitate the design of quality interactive applications. InterMod proposes using user-centred models which allow to define the application requirements and to describe the human-computer dialogue; both of them are embedded in an early prototype evaluation process. The requirements models, the presentation model, and the software model are involved in this process. Several tools guide the process described in InterMod, and here we focus on Diagram. Diagram gathers the requirements models, automatically creates a user-friendly prototype and brings the developers and users into the process design in a continuous evaluate phase. All the models are saved in XML allowing communication among them. Some examples made with that tool illustrate our approach. © 2009 IADIS.},

The cluster was appointed Norwegian Centre of Expertise Instrumentation (NCEI) in April 2006 by the Ministry of local government and regional development and the Ministry of trade and industry. The intention of NCEI is to enhance the innovation process through cooperation between companies, research institutes, universities and public authorities. This paper describes the NCEI research project on standards and software development that started in January 2007 and my personal experiences made in the field of certification of safety equipment since January 1987. The final paper will also include NCEI work in progress until end of 2007. The purpose of the NCEI project is to improve safety instruments, and at the same time improve the development process for safety instruments/systems. The participants shall learn from each other and studies of safety requirements, having in mind there have been and will be more safety requirements. The NCEI companies have succeeded very well in the market the last years. The amount of software in their safety instruments/systems is growing fast. The software part of their total development projects is increasing and now constitutes more than 50% of the development costs. Some of the companies have started to use freeware and/or agile software methods. Increased use of both freeware and agile software methods is foreseen and reported by the project members. Their products fail in at least one of the tests the first time the product is tested by the laboratories belonging to the certification bodies. The number of safety requirements increases for the NCEI companies due to: general increase in safety standards, they sell to more countries, regions and business sectors, and due to extension of the technology scope of their products. NCEI has established cooperation with the Norwegian "National Standardization Strategy" project that started in 2007. This project has concluded that the companies have to study further the use of free software and start cooperation with other free software projects and organizations, including case studies both for free software and agile methods. The NCEI project will study safety requirement challenges and how the participants can develop instruments with no failures at the time when they deliver the instruments to the test laboratories for approval.},

  abstract      = {Infrastructure refers to those resources and items required to successfully support and operate information systems. Security refers to policies, procedures, software, and hardware designed to insure that data in information systems are protected against accidental or inappropriate destruction, alteration, or access. Properly supported, infrastructure competency allows an organization to maintain agility in responding to strategic directives and tactical changes. Infrastructure and security together provide the day-to-day operational support for the hardware and software, thus forming a critical component of the organization. Proper management of security requires attention to infrastructure and information system designs, as well as the organization adhering to strict and appropriate personnel practices. Both infrastructure and security are among the many invisible processes and resources required to implement and sustain a successful clinical computing system. Some resources, such as a data center, must be available prior to implementation of these systems; many other resources, such as those supporting security, should be available prior to implementation, but are often deferred until problems occur. Most infrastructure requirements continue and expand after the system is in use. Although organizations can purchase services through outside contracted vendors, those developing skills in their own personnel can use resources more cost effectively, saving as much as 25-40%, particularly in areas such as disaster management. In the longer term, the use of contracted services can result in the loss of skills necessary for making strategic decisions, putting into question whether the estimated savings of contracting can be achieved. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract      = {Efforts at player motion tracking have traditionally involved a range of data collection techniques from live observation to post-event video analysis where player movement patterns are manually recorded and categorized to determine performance effectiveness. Due to the considerable time required to manually collect and analyse such data, research has tended to focus only on small numbers of players within predefined playing areas. Whilst notational analysis is a convenient, practical and typically inexpensive technique, the validity and reliability of the process can vary depending on a number of factors, including how many observers are used, their experience, and the quality of their viewing perspective. Undoubtedly the application of automated tracking technology to team sports has been hampered because of inadequate video and computational facilities available at sports venues. However, the complex nature of movement inherent to many physical activities also represents a significant hurdle to overcome. Athletes tend to exhibit quick and agile movements, with many unpredictable changes in direction and also frequent collisions with other players. Each of these characteristics of player behaviour violate the assumptions of smooth movement on which computer tracking algorithms are typically based. Systems such as TRAKUS™, SoccerMan™, TRAKPERFORMANCE™, Pfinder™ and Prozone™ all provide extrinsic feedback information to coaches and athletes. However, commercial tracking systems still require a fair amount of operator intervention to process the data after capture and are often limited by the restricted capture environments that can be used and the necessity for individuals to wear tracking devices. Whilst some online tracking systems alleviate the requirements of manual tracking, to our knowledge a completely automated system suitable for sports performance is not yet commercially available. Automatic motion tracking has been used successfully in other domains outside of elite sport performance, notably for surveillance in the military and security industry where automatic recognition of moving objects is achievable because identification of the objects is not necessary. The current challenge is to obtain appropriate video sequences that can robustly identify and label people over time, in a cluttered environment containing multiple interacting people. This problem is often compounded by the quality of video capture, the relative size and occlusion frequency of people, and also changes in illumination. Potential applications of an automated motion detection system are offered, such as: planning tactics and strategies; measuring team organisation; providing meaningful kinematic feedback; and objective measures of intervention effectiveness in team sports, which could benefit coaches, players, and sports scientists. © 2008 Adis Data Information BV.

  abstract        = {The development of security-critical large-scale distributed software systems is a difficult and error prone process. As we learnt from practical experiences, it is especially difficult to manually define and manage security policies, for example for access control, with a sufficient level of assurance. The human security administrator is not able to cope with the high complexity of the interactions of the application and the low level, platform specific security policy. Therefore, a new approach is needed to improve the correctness of the security policies, and to make security policies manageable. This is particularly eminent in two areas: serviceoriented architecture (SOA) style environments where agility support and reuse (also of policies!) are critical; and in environments where collaborative decision making (CDM) has to be implemented, which typically requires agile secure information sharing (especially sensitive cross-organisation between coalition partners). This paper shows how security engineering can be integrated into a model-driven software development process. In our approach, UML models of the application's functional properties are flexibly augmented with security relevant information. Together with a high level security policy defined by the security administrator, this augmented functional model is then used in an automatic model transformation to generate the platform specific security policy with high assurance. With this approach, which also supports the separation of concerns in model based software engineering, we can automatically generate security-critical applications for different middleware platforms like our SecureMiddleware, which is an extended implementation of the CORBA Components Model with improved support for properties like security. The concepts, platforms and tools presented in the paper are currently used for the development of several large-scale and secure applications, for example for building a Virtual Air-Space Management System with strong security requirements, and within the U.S. Naval Research Lab SINS project.},

  abstract        = {Purpose - Nowadays, most of the software development processes still does not provide appropriate support for the development of secure systems. Rational Unified Process (RUP) is a well-known software engineering process that provides a disciplined approach to assigning tasks and responsibilities; however, it has little support for development of secure systems. This work aims to present a proposal of RUP for the development of secure systems. Design/methodology/ approach - In order to obtain the proposed RUP, the authors consider security as a knowledge area (discipline) and they define workflow, activities and roles according to the architecture of process engineering Unified Method Architecture (UMA). A software development was used to assess qualitatively the extended RUP. Findings - Based on the development, the authors find that the proposed process produces security requirements in a more systematic way and results in the definition of better system architecture. Research limitations/implications - The proposed extension requires specific adaptation if other development processes such as agile process and waterfall are employed. Practical implications - The extension facilitates, the management of execution, and control of the activities and tasks related to security and the development teams can benefit by constructing better quality software. Originality/value - The originality of the paper is the proposal of extension to RUP in order to consider security in a disciplined and organized way. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

  abstract      = {As the Army transforms into a more lethal, lighter and agile force, the technologies that support these systems must decrease in size while increasing in intelligence. Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) are one such technology that the Army and DOD will rely on heavily to accomplish these objectives. Conditions for utilization of MEMS by the military are unique. Operational and storage environments for the military are significantly different than those found in the commercial sector. Issues unique to the military include; high G-forces during gun launch, extreme temperature and humidity ranges, extended periods of inactivity (20 years plus) and interaction with explosives and propellants. The military operational environments in which MEMS will be stored or required to function are extreme and far surpass any commercial operating conditions. Security and encryption are a must for all MEMS communication, tracking, or data reporting devices employed by the military. Current and future military applications of MEMS devices include safety and arming devices, fuzing devices, various guidance systems, sensors/detectors, inertial measurement units, tracking devices, radio frequency devices, wireless Radio Frequency Identifications (RFIDs) and network systems, GPS's, radar systems, mobile base systems and information technology. MEMS embedded into these weapons systems will provide the military with new levels of speed, awareness, lethality, and information dissemination. The system capabilities enhanced by MEMS will translate directly into tactical and strategic military advantages. While reliance on MEMS devices has been increasing, limited studies have been performed to assess their reliability and identify failure mechanisms. Accordingly, the US Army Corrosion Office at Picatinny, NJ has initiated the "Storage & Quality Requirements for Military MEMS" as part of their MEMS Reliability Assessment Program to address these issues. The goals of the MEMS Reliability Assessment Program are to: 1) establish the reliability of MEMS devices including the impact of transportation, long term storage, operating environment, packaging & interconnection issues, 2) analyze the compatibility of MEMS devices with energetic and other hazardous materials found in military items, 3) identify failure mechanisms and failure rates, 4) develop accelerated test protocols for assessing the reliability of MEMS, S) develop reliability models for these devices, 6) identify a standardizing body, standard terminology, definitions, and categories for MEMS devices and 7) determine potential test methodologies for assessing these mechanisms. Current ongoing efforts in support of the program include: 1) an assessment of the long-term storage performance and standards requirements, 2) initiation of ESS testing for the identification of failure mechanisms of selected devices, 3) drafting of a joint test protocol for assessment of the corrosion potential of MEMS devices, 4) assessment of applicability of reliability software packages for use with MEMS devices and 5) development of test guidelines for the assessment of MEMS reliability. This program will benefit the MEMS user community by filling the information gap that currently exists for reliability, including: Assessment of the operational environments in which the military MEMS device may be utilized Determining & developing methods to preserve MEMS devices during long term storage before they are designed into products Independent assessment of reliability that cannot be obtained from private industry Establishment of reliability data that will be fed back into development & design to improve MEMS devices Production & design process can be vastly improved increasing yields that will drive costs down With the rapid growth of the MEMS industry and the potential for MEMS utilization in advanced weapon systems, it is crucial to consider the reliability of this emerging technology in the early stages of development.},

From the business point of view, the security market is mature and highly competitive, although market needs can change even daily and there is no room for mistakes. Technically, the challenge is the ability to find and catch the threats as soon as they arise. F-Secure has been one of the leading companies in applying agile software development methods, even though F-Secure works with most challenging requirements like security critiality, short time-to-market, frequently changing requirements, and high quality. At the moment, F-Secure has a software product life cycle process, which is built on agile methods. The difference to the earlier process, which was based on "mature" models, is significant. This keynote speech will address those differences and describe the experiences F-Secure has made with agile methods. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

Experience shows that benefits include improved agility, lower costs, better alignment of the business and IT, user adoption and support for business innovation. An SOA application sees applications as building blocks for services provided to end users. This allows re-use of applications across the enterprise. The most commonly-used components of an SOA are technologies such as web services, portal frameworks, application servers, integration frameworks and security frameworks. The desire to reduce cost by re-using what an enterprise already has, and also increase flexibility by reducing the time to implement a new service, has led enterprises to adopt SOAs.},

  abstract        = {Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) has become a promising paradigm for software development due to its benefits in cost-efficiency, agility, and adaptability. One of the most important research topics in SOA is to identify appropriate web services for a service composition so as to fulfill business requirements. Services selection focuses on selecting best services among a bunch of services with same or similar functions but having different QoS (Quality of Service). Many previous approaches have been proposed to optimize service selection. However, in current research, quality values normally come from service providers, who have high possibility to exaggerate these data for advertisement. In addition, we also argue that reputation based on an average user rating is not enough to indicate the trust degree of web services and service provider. In this paper, we focus on solving these problems. First we describe a QoS broker-based service selection scenario. Based on the scenario, we propose a Trust model, which includes QoS model, decision model and trust correction. We apply a statistical method of Paired t-test to model trust correction. By experiments, we verify that web service capacity and trust corrections have significant effects on web service selection. We also verify that the proposed approach is better than traditional approaches in terms of consumer satisfaction degree on selected web services.},

The initial drivers of this synergy are primarily the low power, low cost, low interference wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) networks, although other wireless technologies, such as, WiMAX, wVoIP, Ultra Wideband, Bluetooth and RFID will be covered in this paper. The Wi-Fi devices (hotspots) can be manufactured today on a single chip in the ten-dollar range, and with only increased production, the cost can soon drop to less than one dollar. These low cost devices will be integrated - using a number of advanced wireless technologies, including smart antennas, agile radios and mesh networks all sharing breakthroughs in digital signal processing - into computer controlled, wireless, smart networks. These intelligent networks will be connected to millions and soon billions of new radio-frequency identification device (RFID) sensors. These sensors, like Wi-Fi, are built on a low cost, single chip many no larger than a grain of sand. The sensor data will be wirelessly networked to computer processing and advanced storage devices. This synergy, from the sensor chip via smart networks to the storage device, will deliver "wireless-Internet-on-a-chip" applications. These applications will have the capability to change the way we create things, move commerce and understand our world by monitoring and measuring it in multi-dimensions with minimal human interaction. The large numbers of RFID sensors can track quantities and qualities of materials and objects - their heat, movement and even look for probabilistic changes in the qualities. One of the big drivers of these active RFID/GPS sensors is search and location. Three major customer groups will spend large amounts for the ability to know where people are-all the time. The first group is the government who want to know where potential security threats are. This will include state and local governments who want to monitor individuals on probation and keep tract of certain types of offenders. The second customer group is businesses that want to monitor the whereabouts of their decision makers. Business owners are also tired of not knowing where their salesmen are on a Friday afternoon. The third customer group is parents - primarily mothers, who want to know where their children are - all the time. These three customer groups will propel the synergy of location seasors, smart, agile wireless hardware and software and low-cost networks. These sensor driven networks can vary from large, sophisticated, computer controlled systems to small data gathering networks, operating in the developing world. Especially in the developing world, these sensors will largely operate in wireless local area networks (WLANs) connected to simple, satellite ground terminals. These sensor networks will have little or no latency requirements and thus will be especially satellite friendly. This new revolution of chip-driven, wireless, low cost sensors, networks and applications will provide important new markets for communications satellites.},

abstract={A secure system is one that is protected against specific undesired outcomes. Delivering a secure system, and particularly a secure web application, is not easy. Integrating general-purpose information systems development methods with security development activities could be a useful means to surmount these difficulties [6]. Agile processes, such as Extreme Programming, are of increasing interest in software development. Most significantly for web applications, agile processes encourage and embrace requirements change, which is a desirable characteristic for web application development. In this paper, we present an agile process to deliver secure web applications. The contribution of the research is not the development of a new method or process that addresses security concerns. Rather, we investigate general-purpose information system development methods (e.g., Feature-Driven Development (FDD)) and mature security methods, namely risk analysis, and integrate them to address the development of secure web applications. The key features of our approach are (1) a process capable of dealing with the key challenges of web applications development, namely decreasing life-cycle times and frequently changing requirements; and (2) an iterative approach to risk analysis that integrates security design throughout the development process.},

  abstract      = {With the launch of Windows Vista a few months off, its security prowess is more than a matter of curiosity. Detractors such as Symantec are lining up. We look under the covers at the security features in the run-up to Microsoft's biggest operating system launch since XP hit the streets nearly five years ago. And while we're at it, IE7, also currently in beta, gets the treatment. As the article shows, one of the features Windows Vista introduces is a privilege brokering system named User Account Control which obviates the need to login interactively with what Microsoft sees as 'excessive privilege'. The requirement for excessive privilege often stems from application developers who build code using privileged accounts and hence the software they produce often assumes a similar environment. Previous versions of Microsoft Windows have required privileged accounts to be used to change the system's TimeZone setting. This setting together with several others have been changed to enable control by regular users. With Windows Vista due to be released in early 2007, IT departments across the world are planning for the inevitable. Also currently in beta testing, Internet Explorer 7 is likely to be out by year-end. What can be expected security-wise? Microsoft presents its case. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract      = {Grids are becoming economically viable and productive tools. They provide a way of utilizing a vast array of linked resources such as computing systems, databases and services online within Virtual Organizations (VO). However, today's Grid architectures are not capable of supporting dynamic, agile federation across multiple administrative domains and the main barrier, which hinders dynamic federation over short time scales is security. Federating security and trust is one of the most significant architectural issues in Grids. Existing relevant standards and specifications can be used to federate security services, but do not directly address the dynamic extension of business trust relationships into the digital domain. In this paper we describe an experiment which highlights those challenging architectural issues and forms the basis of an approach that combines a dynamic trust federation and a dynamic authorization mechanism for addressing dynamic security trust federation in Grids. The experiment, made with the prototype described in this paper is used in the NextGRID1 project to define the requirements of next generation Grid architectures adapted to business application needs. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

Moreover, it is generally accepted that non-functional requirements (or NFRs) such as adaptability and security need to be considered at the architectural stage itself in order to ensure that the final software system possess these NFRs. In this paper we propose a framework, the Adaptable Security Architecture Framework (ASAF) that helps to analyze and evaluate the adaptable security for a software system. The applicability of this framework is demonstrated by using ASAF to evaluate the adaptable security of the Windows XP software against the blaster worm and confirming that the architectural modifications for Windows XP actually improved the adaptable security of Windows XP against the blaster worm.},

  abstract      = {Ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) environments often consist of many embedded or handheld devices, either mobile or stationary, communicating with each other through wireless networks to cooperatively perform certain tasks. Recent development in ubicomp provides devices a new capability, situation-awareness, which allows devices to sense and monitor their ambient environment, analyze the current situations, and respond to situation changes by adapting their behavior. Situation-aware (SA) ubicomp software will be very useful in various application areas, such as homeland security, business, education, health care, and environmental control. However, many challenging issues need to be addressed for developing SA ubicomp software. The following are four major challenges for most SA ubicomp software: Severe resource constraints of embedded or handheld devices (communication bandwidth, battery power, computing power, etc.). Ad hoc communications among devices. The efficiency of detecting situation changes in fast changing environments. Volatile software requirements in ubicomp environments. Model-driven development methodologies [1] can effectively separate application logic from the underlying technologies and support rapid development of new interoperability specifications based on proven, tested application models. Middleware is an important enabling technique for model-driven development. However, in ubicomp, it is difficult to create extensive models capturing the volatile software requirements before source code is written, and the congruence of models and implementations is maintained. Agile development methodologies [2] capture just-in-time requirements, but cannot provide support for considering the underlying resource constraints and ad-hoc communication with the application requirements in a systematic way and validate the implementation easily. Model-driven development or agile development alone cannot address all the issues for developing SA ubicomp software. Combining model-driven and agile development [3] seems to be a promising solution. In this address, the current state of the art of model-driven and agile software development will be discussed. In particular, two important enabling techniques, SA middleware [4] and languages for specifying SAW requirements [5], for model-driven agile development (MAD) for SA ubicomp application software will be presented. Future directions for utilizing MAD methodologies to develop SA ubicomp application software with multiple QoS properties will also be discussed. © 2005 IEEE.},

Numerous block ciphers have been proposed and implemented, using a wide and varied range of functional operations. Existing architectures such as microcontrollers do not provide this broad range of support. Therefore, we will present a hardware architecture that achieves efficient block cipher implementation while maintaining flexibility through reconfiguration. In an effort to achieve such a hardware architecture, a study of a wide range of block ciphers was undertaken to develop an understanding of the functional requirements of each algorithm. This study led to the development of COBRA, a reconfigurable architecture for the efficient implementation of block ciphers. A detailed discussion of the top-level architecture, interconnection scheme, and underlying elements of the architecture will be provided. System configuration and on-the-fly reconfiguration will be analyzed, and from this analysis, it will be demonstrated that the COBRA architecture satisfies the requirements for achieving efficient implementation of a wide range of block ciphers that meet the 622 Mbps ATM network encryption throughput requirement. © 2005 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Insider's attacks have become major threats to corporate LANs as data is not protected when it travels across the network, so employees or visitors may connect sniffing devices and copy data for later analysis. Consequently, there is a high demand to adopt an end-to-end security model to ensure secure communications between any two machines within an enterprise. Microsoft Windows XP/2000 OSes, as one of the major driving force in building LANs, have adopted this model which is based on IPSec standard to ensure secure communications between any two Windows XP/2000 machines. Unfortunately, this security model disables a wide range of Intelligent Network Services (INS Services) that are inevitable for operating corporate LANs such as firewalls, IDS, Network Monitoring tools, NAT and Traffic classifications. This paper investigates this critical issue and provides classification of INS Services access requirements as well as a flexible and efficient solution that allows the transport mode of Windows XP/2000's IPSec protocols to co-exist with the INS Services.},
